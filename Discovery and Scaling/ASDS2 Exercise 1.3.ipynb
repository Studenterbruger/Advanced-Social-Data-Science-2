    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to use the keyword expansion technique propsoed in `Computer-Assisted Keyword and Document Set Discovery from Unstructured Text` by King, Lam and Roberts (2017), in order to label a dataset of tweets according to whether or not they are related to covid-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use an initial list of keywords to label the date, and then use supervised learning to expand the list of keywords to get a better sense of how people talk about a topic. It is an iterative approach, meaning that you start with a list of keywords, and expand it, run it again etc. until you saturate the list. The approach also emphasises that you should read some of the text that you label, in order to ensure correct labelling. \n"
