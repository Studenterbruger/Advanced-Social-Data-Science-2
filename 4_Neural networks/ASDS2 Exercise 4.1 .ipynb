First, we will set up the model. Then, we will load the `tweet_eval` dataset and turn it into a Torch dataset (the type of data input that PyTorch can work with). Next, we will train our network on the data using a variant of gradient descent called Adam. Finally, we will evaluate the model's performance.\n",

Please refer to the [documentation of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) for a complete list of layers. Here, the `__init__` method should contain one layer that linearly combines the inputs, and then a softmax activation function, which will produce the outputs.\n",

    " - compute the z values of the node (linear combinations of the inputs, using the [Linear](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) neural net building block). There should be as many outputs as classes here (since the probability of each class gets to be based on its own linear combination of the features)\n",
    " - pass them through the [Softmax](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html) activation function with `dim=1` to normalize them (squeeze the probabilities of all output classes so that they sum to one)\n",
